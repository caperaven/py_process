# process_api

## Description
This is an extensible library that allows processes to be defined and executed in either Python or JSON. 
It serves as an execution pipeline, enabling the chaining of different modules and their actions to create a process. 
By defining processes using JSON files, it offers the flexibility of customization without the need for code recompilation, making it ideal for free and open-source projects.

Please note that this library is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. Once it reaches maturity, 
a commercial license will be available for purchase. However, it will always be available under the MIT license for free and open-source projects.
